# highway-sequencer ðŸ›£ COMPX Project with [Luka Kramer](https://github.com/remarkies)


**Your composing skills lack the melodic genius of a good old American highway? We got you covered:**


Select a webcam and place your notes on the highway when a car passes through it the note will be triggered. ðŸŽ¶

The project is a pure frontend application (Angular) that runs TensorFlow.js models from [tfjs-yolo](https://github.com/shaqian/tfjs-yolo) on selected webcam live feeds from around the world.
